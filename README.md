# Classification-Algorithms-Visualiser
A machine learning web app built with streamlit, that allows user to choose any classification algorithm and let them set the hyperparameter values dynamically to visualise the algorithm. This web app is used to classify weather a mushroom is edible or poisonous with the model trained on the mushroom dataset which can also be viewed as raw dataset in the app. The algorithms used for classification are Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest and the output displays the accuracy, precision score and visualises the algorithm by plotting Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve.
